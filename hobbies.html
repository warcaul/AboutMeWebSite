            <p>
                Boxing has been a significant part of my life for over 8 years. Throughout this time, I have
                participated in numerous competitions and earned valuable experience in the ring. In Ukraine, I achieved
                a first-class degree (or "перший разряд"), which is just below the Candidate Master of Sports (КМС)
                level. It was a proud achievement for me, reflecting the hard work and dedication I put into the sport.
                Boxing taught me discipline, resilience, and mental toughness, qualities that continue to influence my
                life today.

            <p>
                Boxing requires more than just physical strength—it’s also about strategy and technique. One important
                tip for beginners is to focus on footwork. Proper foot positioning allows you to move quickly and
                maintain balance while attacking or defending. Another key to success is mastering the jab, as it’s the
                most fundamental punch that sets up many other combinations. As you advance, learning defensive
                techniques such as slipping and rolling can help you avoid punches while staying in control of the
                fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most important tricks I learned throughout my boxing career is the importance of mental
                focus. Even when you’re physically prepared, staying calm and focused in the ring is essential.
                Visualization techniques helped me immensely—imagining myself executing successful moves before stepping
                into the ring gave me confidence. Another key aspect is endurance; boxing matches can be intense, and
                having the stamina to keep going when you're tired is crucial. It’s the hours of training and
                conditioning that prepare you for the hardest moments in a match.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have many memorable experiences from my boxing journey, but one stands out. During a competition, I
                lost a fight because the judges gave my opponent 10 extra points without any clear reason. It was a
                frustrating experience, as I felt the decision was unfair. But looking back, it taught me a valuable
                lesson about the unpredictability of competition and the importance of controlling what I can—my
                performance in the ring. Despite this setback, I continued to train hard, and the lessons I learned
                helped me improve both as a boxer and as a person.

            <h2 id="warhammer">Warhammer 40K</h2>
            <img src="images/mechanicus.jpg" alt="img" class="hobbiesImg right">
            <p>
                My interest in Warhammer started with the computer game "Dawn of War," which introduced me to the vast
                and rich universe of Warhammer 40K. The game’s deep lore, epic battles, and intricate factions
                fascinated me. As I delved deeper into the Warhammer universe, I discovered more about the factions,
                their stories, and their motivations, eventually leading me to get a tattoo of the symbol of Adeptus
                Mechanicus. This symbol has a deep personal meaning for me as it represents both my love for the
                Warhammer lore and the mechanized, relentless pursuit of knowledge that the faction embodies. The
                Adeptus Mechanicus are dedicated to preserving and expanding the ancient technologies of the Imperium,
                and their unwavering commitment to their mission resonated with my own dedication to learning and
                personal growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Adeptus Mechanicus are one of the most fascinating factions in Warhammer 40K, with their belief in
                the "Machine God" and their relentless pursuit of technological perfection. They are a technologically
                advanced group that controls much of the Imperium's tech and weapons, often using rituals and a blend of
                ancient tech and religious reverence. The symbol I chose for my tattoo represents their devotion to the
                Machine God, and it embodies the balance of faith, knowledge, and technology that defines the faction.
                For me, it symbolizes not just my love for the Warhammer 40K universe but also the idea of continuously
                striving for improvement and knowledge, no matter how difficult or complex the journey may be.

            <p>
                When I was a child, I couldn't afford to buy the expensive miniatures or sets for Warhammer. However, my
                love for the game didn’t stop me. I got creative and managed to build my own wargame inspired by the
                Warhammer 40K universe. I created my own models and rules, allowing me to experience the game’s tactics
                and strategy even without the official miniatures. This DIY approach was not just about necessity but
                also a way for me to bring my passion for the universe to life, despite the financial limitations I
                faced. It taught me resourcefulness, creativity, and how to make the most of what I had available.
            </p>

            <p>
                Warhammer has since become more than just a hobby for me; it is a window into a world filled with lore,
                strategy, and creativity. My passion for the game has led me to connect with many other fans and share
                experiences, tactics, and customizations. Whether it’s painting miniatures or exploring the deep stories
                of the Warhammer universe, it has been a rewarding journey of both creative expression and strategic
                thinking.

            <h2 id="guitar">Guitar</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for playing the guitar began in high school when one of my classmates brought in an old,
                nearly broken Soviet-era guitar. Despite its terrible sound, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy
                whenever I played it. The guitar was far from perfect, but the experience of making music on it was
                something truly special. That initial spark of excitement inspired me to work all summer to save up
                enough money to buy my own guitar. Once I had it, I dedicated myself to learning and playing every
                single day for a year, diving deep into the world of music and discovering the power of self-expression
                through sound.

            </ol>

            <p>
                While I’m not playing as much now as I did back then, the guitar still holds a special place in my
                heart. Sometimes, when I need to release my emotions or just unwind, I’ll pick it up and strum a few
                chords. Even though I’m not playing daily anymore, the guitar remains a great way for me to connect with
                my emotions and express myself in ways words cannot. It’s a hobby that continues to bring me joy,
                whether I'm practicing new songs or just letting my feelings out through music.
            </p>

            <p>
                Playing the guitar taught me discipline, patience, and the joy of making something with my own hands. It
                was through those long hours of practice that I learned to appreciate both the journey of learning and
                the moments of emotional release music can provide. Though I’m not as committed to it now, I’ll always
                carry the memories of those early days of guitar playing with me.

            <p>
                I just started kayaking this year when I joined my university's kayaking club. It’s been an exciting new
                experience, and I’ve quickly developed a passion for it. According to my clubmates, I’m doing really
                well for a beginner, and they’ve encouraged me to take part in an upcoming competition, Varsities. The
                sport has provided me with a new challenge, and I’m eager to test my skills in a competitive
                environment. It’s also a great way for me to connect with nature and stay active while enjoying the
                thrill of the water.

            <p>
                Kayaking is an exhilarating sport that requires both physical strength and mental focus. The balance of
                paddling and maneuvering through the water can be challenging at first, but with practice, it becomes
                incredibly rewarding. One important tip for beginners is to focus on maintaining a steady and controlled
                stroke, as this will help improve speed and stability. Another helpful suggestion is to practice balance
                in the boat before trying more advanced maneuvers—this is crucial for avoiding capsizing and ensuring a
                smoother ride.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although I’m new to kayaking, the sense of accomplishment I feel after each practice session is
                motivating. The experience of learning something new and improving each time I get on the water has been
                exciting. I look forward to competing in Varsities and seeing how I fare, and I’m committed to
                continuing my training and honing my skills. Whether it’s for fun or competition, kayaking is a hobby
                that has brought me a sense of joy and personal achievement, and I’m excited to see where this journey
                takes me.
