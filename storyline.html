                <h5>My home city Melitopol</h5>
            </div>

            <p>
                I was born in 2003 in the vibrant city of Melitopol, Ukraine. My hometown, known for its rich culture
                and warm, close-knit community, played a significant role in shaping my early years and my outlook on
                life. Growing up here, I was surrounded by the dynamic energy of a city that felt like a blend of
                tradition and progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                My family provided the perfect foundation for my journey. My mother was a talented hairdresser whose
                artistic skills brought beauty and creativity into my daily life. From her, I learned about the
                importance of detail, patience, and the way that a person’s work could impact others. Her artistry was
                not only about skill with scissors but also about connecting with people, understanding their
                personalities, and creating something unique that made them feel more confident.
            </p>
            <p>
                My father, on the other hand, was a businessman, an entrepreneur with a mind always focused on the next
                opportunity. Through him, I saw firsthand the value of hard work, resilience, and determination. He
                showed me that building something from the ground up requires courage, vision, and the ability to adapt.
                His ambition and work ethic were inspiring, and I admired his ability to balance the demands of business
                with the needs of our family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up with these two influences—creativity from my mother and business acumen from my father—I
                began to appreciate the power of combining passion with practicality. My parents' contrasting worlds
                taught me that success and fulfillment are often found at the intersection of creativity and hard work.
                Their guidance has been instrumental in my own journey, as I seek to forge a path that honors both my
                artistic side and my drive for achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back, I feel incredibly grateful for the values and lessons my family and hometown have
                instilled in me. These early influences have shaped who I am and continue to inspire me as I explore new
                opportunities and build my own future.

            <p>
                In 2009, I embarked on an exciting new chapter in my life as I entered my first year at School Number 15
                in Melitopol. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, stepping into a world of
                classrooms, teachers, and new friendships. It was a world full of possibility, and I was ready to take
                it on.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the very beginning, my parents were there to support me every step of the way. They understood how
                important these early years were and encouraged me to put my heart into my studies. With their guidance,
                I quickly learned the value of hard work and the pride that comes with doing my best.
            </p>
            <p>
                School life wasn’t always easy, but my parents' constant encouragement made a huge difference. They
                celebrated my successes, no matter how small, and helped me through challenges, teaching me that
                learning is a journey and that each step brings me closer to my goals. Their support gave me the
                confidence to dive into my studies and develop a love for learning that I carry with me to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflecting on those early school days, I realize how lucky I was to have such a strong foundation built
                on my parents' love and belief in me. School Number 15 was just the starting point, but it taught me
                that with hard work and a supportive family, anything is possible.

                <h5>Me during one of the training sessions</h5>
            </figure>
            <p>
                In 2012, I discovered my passion for boxing, a hobby that would define the next eight years of my life.
                What started as a way to stay active soon became an obsession, as I dedicated myself to the sport.
                Boxing taught me not only physical strength but also discipline, focus, and resilience. Over the years,
                I grew both as an athlete and as an individual, pushing myself to reach new heights and face
                ever-greater challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my boxing journey, I participated in over 20 competitions, constantly striving to improve. My
                commitment paid off, earning me numerous accolades along the way. Among these were 8 golden medals and
                10 silver medals, each representing countless hours of training, sacrifice, and determination. The
                pinnacle of my career came during the Ushakova-Hatina regional competition, where I competed against
                approximately 1200 fighters. It was one of the most intense experiences of my life and a moment I will
                never forget.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 golden medals</li>
                <li>10 silver medals</li>
                <li>23 competitions</li>
                <li>First class instuctor in Boxing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, my boxing career came to an end due to an injury I sustained during one of my matches.
                The trauma from this injury was too severe, and I had to make the difficult decision to walk away from
                the sport I loved. Although it was heartbreaking to leave boxing behind, the lessons I learned from my
                time in the ring continue to shape my life today, teaching me the value of hard work, perseverance, and
                the importance of never giving up.

                In 2014, I took my first steps into the world of science competitions, focusing primarily on math while
                also exploring biology and chemistry. With a strong dedication to my studies, I began attending numerous
                science events, each one sharpening my skills and expanding my knowledge. These competitions were more
                than just challenges; they were opportunities to grow intellectually and meet other students who shared
                my passion for science. My efforts paid off as I consistently improved, learning new concepts and
                developing critical thinking skills along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my most significant achievements came in high school when I won the "Обласну Олімпіаду з
                Екології" (Regional Ecology Olympiad). This victory was a proud moment for me, showcasing not only my
                knowledge of ecology but also the result of years of hard work and determination. It was a milestone in
                my scientific journey, reinforcing my love for learning and proving that dedication truly brings
                results. Over time, my participation in these events continued to fuel my curiosity and passion for the
                sciences.

                In 2020, I took a major step in my academic career by beginning my studies at the Kyiv Polytechnic
                Institute (KPI). I was awarded a government grant, which allowed me to pursue a bachelor's degree in
                Biotechnology at the School of Biotechnology. The beginning of this new chapter in my life was filled
                with excitement and a deep sense of responsibility. I knew that studying at such a prestigious
                institution would open many doors, and I was determined to make the most of this opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my first year at KPI, I was fortunate enough to secure internships in two very different but
                equally interesting laboratories: one focused on chemistry and the other on agricultural genetics. These
                experiences were invaluable, providing me with practical, hands-on knowledge that complemented my
                academic learning. Working in these labs allowed me to explore the diverse applications of
                biotechnology, from chemical processes to agricultural advancements, and gave me a broader understanding
                of the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my studies, I also became involved in a computer club, where I found a new passion for social
                media management (SMM). I took on the role of SMM specialist, responsible for managing the club's online
                presence and engaging with its audience. This experience helped me develop my skills in digital
                marketing, content creation, and online communication, opening up a new area of interest beyond my
                scientific studies. It was an exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of technology and
                communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as the war began, my life and studies were abruptly interrupted. The conflict forced me to
                pause my education and leave my home, and I could no longer continue my studies at KPI. This sudden turn
                of
                events made it difficult for me to stay on the path I had envisioned in biotechnology, and I found
                myself questioning whether this was still the field I wanted to pursue. The war had a profound impact on
                my future plans, and I realized that I had to reassess my direction in life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the challenges and uncertainty, I remain grateful for the experiences and knowledge I gained
                during my time at KPI. The internships in the chemistry and agricultural genetics laboratories enriched
                my understanding of science and research. Though I have paused my studies, the lessons I learned
                continue to influence my thinking and shape my personal journey. I may not have found my place in
                biotechnology yet, but I know that the experiences I had will guide me as I move forward and explore new
                possibilities.

                As I settled into university life, I also joined the kayaking club, which has become a wonderful part of
                my experience. Not only has kayaking provided me with a great way to stay active, but it has also
                introduced me to many amazing people. The club is filled with like-minded individuals who share a
                passion for adventure and the outdoors. I’ve already made lasting friendships and enjoyed unforgettable
                moments on the water, which have been a great balance to my academic journey.
            </p>
